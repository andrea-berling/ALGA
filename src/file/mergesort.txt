MERGE SORT 


Description of algorithm

Algorithm based on Divide-et-impera technique.
It consists on divide recursively the array in 
two segments and call the recursive function on
each segment.
After the recursive call, the mergesort procedure
call a merge function that merges the two segment
of the array in one sorted array.


Pseudocode

function mergesort (a[], left, right)
    if left < right then
        center ← (left + right) / 2
        mergesort(a, left, center)
        mergesort(a, center+1, right)
        merge(a, left, center, right)

Complexity: O(n logn)
