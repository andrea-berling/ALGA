MERGE SORT 


Description of algorithm

Merge Sort is a Divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm
It basically divides the array to be sorted into two
parts, sorts them and then merges them into a sorted
array. To sort the two parts, Merge Sort calls itself
recursively on the two parts. An array (or a part of
an array) of length 1 is considered ordered.

Pseudocode

function mergesort (A[], left, right)
    if left < right then
        center ← (left + right) / 2
        mergesort(A, left, center)
        mergesort(A, center + 1, right)
        merge(A, left, center, right)

Complexity: ϴ(n logn)
